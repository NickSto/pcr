Utility scripts
===============

These are various duplex-related utility scripts I've written to analyze duplex data, deal with formats, or even simulate whole duplex experiments.

They're kept here mainly for my use, but anyone else is free to use them as they see fit. Keep in mind, though, that anything may change at any time.
